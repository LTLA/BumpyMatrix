This package implements the `BumpyMatrix` class and several subclasses for holding non-scalar objects in each entry of the matrix.
This is akin to a ragged array but the raggedness is in the third dimension, much like a bumpy surface - hence the name.
Check out the documentation on the [Bioconductor landing page](https://bioconductor.org/packages/BumpyMatrix) for more details.
