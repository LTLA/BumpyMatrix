Title: Bumpy Matrix of Non-Scalar Objects
Description: Implements the BumpyMatrix class and several subclasses
    for holding non-scalar objects in each entry of the matrix. This is 
    akin to a ragged array but the raggedness is in the third dimension,
    much like a bumpy surface - hence the name. Of particular
    interest is the BumpyDFrameMatrix, where each entry is a Bioconductor
    data frame. This allows us to naturally represent multivariate data in a
    format that is compatible with two-dimensional containers like the 
    SummarizedExperiment and MultiAssayExperiment objects.
