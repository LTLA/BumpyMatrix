Title: Bumpy Matrix of Non-Scalar Objects
Description: Implements the BumpyMatrix class and several subclasses
    for holding non-scalar objects in each entry of the matrix. This is akin to
    a ragged array but the raggedness is in the third dimension, much like
    a bumpy surface - hence the name. Of particular interest is the
    BumpyDataFrameMatrix, where each entry is a Bioconductor data frame.
    This allows us to naturally represent multivariate data in a format
    that is compatible with two-dimensional containers like the
    SummarizedExperiment and MultiAssayExperiment objects.
